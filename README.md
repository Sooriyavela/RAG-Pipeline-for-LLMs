# 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

This project demonstrates the creation of a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using tools such as `wikipedia` and `faiss-cpu`. RAG combines dense retrieval with generative models like those from Hugging Face to answer questions based on retrieved context.

## 🚀 Features

- Retrieves real-world content from Wikipedia.
- Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast dense vector search.
- Intended to integrate with transformer-based language models for question answering or summarization.

## 📦 Dependencies

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install wikipedia
pip install faiss-cpu
pip install transformers
pip install sentence-transformers
